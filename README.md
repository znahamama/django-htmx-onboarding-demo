# Django + HTMX Onboarding Demo

A small Django demo application built to practice frontend-backend integration using Django views and templates.

## Overview
This project implements a simple onboarding flow where users submit basic information through a form. The backend uses Django models and views to handle GET and POST requests, while the frontend uses HTMX to submit the form asynchronously and update the UI without a full page reload.

## Features
- Django models for data storage
- Django views handling GET and POST request flows
- HTMX for asynchronous form submission
- Partial templates for dynamic UI updates
- Django admin panel for reviewing submissions

## Purpose
Built to understand and practice Django + HTMX workflows commonly used in real-world Django applications.
